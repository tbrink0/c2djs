Classes to add:
Gradient
Polygon (user-defined points)
Line (with all the lineStyle properties)
Arc (with all the lineStyle properties)
Path (add Lines and Arcs onto a Path to create a shape even more complex than a polygon)

Lots of convenience features would be awesome; for example a better API for HitMethods, maybe the ability to simply
attach a HitRegion to a shape. Things like simpler Rectangle arguments, etc.
